# About me

I am a student at BHASVIC (Brighton & Hove And Sussex VI form College) studying Maths, Music and Computer Science A levels at the college. 

After college, I aim to do a degree related to digital sound design or a similar course that will link my computer science skills with my music skills. I'm not entirely sure on the specific job I would like to do after university, but I know it will be in the field of audio and software engineering. I have been interested in a few jobs such as acoustic engineering or sound design for TV and movies. 

I enjoy my A level subjects, especially computer science and music. In my A level computer science course, we have been working on a mix of programming and coursework, with occasional programming projects to improve our practical skills. Music A level is quite similar in structure with a mix of theory, performance and composition. I enjoy each equally but I have found composition and theory especially enjoyable. I would say I am very passionate about music, so it would be a high priority when looking for uni courses and carreers.

I also have GCSE in english and maths and a bronze Duke of Edinborough award. Recently, I also completed the Carbon Litercy course which involves researching our impact on climate change and I will be considering my impact to the environment when choosing a carreer.

Computer science A level involves team projects which have in turn improved my leadership and team skills significantly. I now feel confident in leading a team and also pulling my weight in a group. There has been a large improvement in my work output in both quality and amount since I started the A level course.

## My Computer Science work

In computer science, we complete both solo and group porgramming projects. Here are all of the things I made in 2024/2025

We initially learned how to program in C and completed programming chapters that tought us different programming techniques. Here are the repositories for the C chapters:
